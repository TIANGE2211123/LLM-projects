# Seeking Medical Advice and Medicine Butler Project

## 1. Project Requirements Overview

### 1.1 Overview
The "Seeking Medical Advice and Medicine Butler" project aims to provide users with a convenient and intelligent medical consultation service platform through advanced artificial intelligence technology. The system is mainly divided into three modules:
- **Intelligent Q&A Interaction**: The system interacts with users through intelligent Q&A models to provide medical consultation and suggestions.
- **Medical Database Management**: Administrators can query, modify, add and delete medical databases.
- **User Management**: The system provides user login, registration and user information management functions.

The system is designed based on the Streamlit framework. The client is responsible for interface design and interaction, and the server is responsible for data management and query result return.

### 1.2 Main Functions
The design of the medical large model Q&A system includes the following modules:
| Serial number | Module name | Main function |
| ---- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1 | User management module | Realize user login, registration and information management. |
| 2 | Question and answer interactive management module | Supports users to select large models, intelligent diagnosis, file upload diagnosis, and multiple dialogue window functions. |
| 3 | Medical database management module | Data crawling and sorting, MySQL database connection. |
